### 2. Clone It

Before cloning the repository, navigate to your **Desktop** directory. We're doing this on the desktop for simplicity.

**For Windows:**
Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\<username>\Desktop
```

**For macOS:**
Open Terminal and run:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

Where to get your repository-url (**Do this in your own fork**):

Once you're on your Desktop, clone your forked repository:
```bash
git clone <your-forked-repository-url>
```

> **Note:** Make sure to use the URL from **your own fork**, not the original repository. You can find it by clicking the green "Code" button on your forked repository page.

### 3. Open It in Visual Studio Code

After cloning, a folder with the same name will appear on your Desktop. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code to start the exercises.

```bash
cd GitHub-Advance
code .
```

## Running the Scripts

The scripts inside this repo will populate your git log to set up your local repository for the exercises. Run the scripts in your editor terminal when instructed during the workshop.

**For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
bash populate_repo_squash.sh
```

**For Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process 
.\populate_repo_squash.ps1
```

## What the Scripts Do

### populate_repo_squash.sh / populate_repo_squash.ps1

Creates a series of commits for practicing:
- **Squashing commits** - Multiple commits to `config.txt` that modify DEBUG and PORT settings
- **Rewording commits** - A commit with vague message ("update config") to practice better commit messages

After running the script, you'll have:
- 6 commits modifying `config.txt` (for squash practice)
- 1 commit creating `settings.txt` (for reword practice)

## Exercise Files

- `error.py` - Dummy file for practicing Git operations (safe to delete)
- `config.txt` - Generated by scripts for squash exercises
- `settings.txt` - Generated by scripts for reword exercises
